The main museum, which used to serve as the county's National Guard Armory, features a time-line of Winona County history, an award-winning children's exhibit, a large library and archives, collection storage, offices, programming space, a gift shop and used bookstore. The Society also operates two smaller museums, the Bunnell House, an 1850s Gothic style house, and the Arches Museum, a complex of buildings and exhibits focused on the agricultural and pioneer history of the county. The Society maintains a very active educational programming schedule, and features many special events and publications throughout the year.","creator":"Winona County Historical Society","date":"1870 - 1928","rights":"These images may not be reproduced for any reason without the express written consent of the Winona County Historical Society."}}},{"setSpec":"winona","setName":"Winona State University","setDescription":{"oclcdc":{"xmlns:dc":"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/","xmlns:oclcterms":"http://purl.org/oclc/terms/","xmlns:dcterms":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","xmlns:dcmitype":"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/","xmlns:xsi":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance","xsi:schemaLocation":"http://purl.org/oclc/terms/\n           http://svn.dev.oclc.org/svn/Crosswalk_PG/trunk/schemas/oclcterms/oclcterms.xsd","recordSetIdentifier":"winona","recordTransportIdentifier":"oai:reflections.mndigital.org:winona","recordContentSource":["MNU","CNTNT"],"recordIdentifier":{"xsi:type":"http://purl.org/oclc/terms/oclcrecordnumber"},"title":"Winona State University (Digital collection)","subject":"Winona County; Minnesota; United States","description":"The Winona State University library holds archives related to the records and early development of the institution, the oldest \"normal school\" west of the Mississippi River and the birthplace of the National Education Association.
